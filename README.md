# package-dependency-analysis
Package Dependency Analysis for top 100 projects on GitHub Language wise.

## what exactly are we doing?
- Most Software Projects depend on multiple opensource packages/dependecies.
- We are trying to analyse these dependencies to 
    1. generate the dependency graph, mapping direct, indirect and transitive dependencies.
    2. perform co-occurence analysis of the packages.
    3. generate the co-occurence graph.
